<div id="purpose" class="container">
  <h1>The purpose of the Digestive System in Human</h1>
  <section>
      <h2>Ingestion</h2>
      <p>The digestive system begins its function with the intake of food. This process involves the consumption of various nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, which are necessary for the body's growth, energy, and maintenance.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Mechanical and Chemical Digestion</h2>
      <p>The food undergoes both mechanical and chemical digestion.Mechanical digestion involves the physical breakdown of food into smaller particles through chewing in the mouth and the churning movements of the stomach. Chemical digestion involves the action of enzymes that break down complex molecules into simpler forms that can be absorbed.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Absorption of Nutrients</h2>
      <p>The small intestine is primarily responsible for absorbing nutrients. Nutrients such as amino acids, fatty acids, glucose, vitamins, and minerals are absorbed into the bloodstream and transported to various cells and tissues for energy production, growth, and repair.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Transportation and Storage</h2>
      <p>The digestive system helps in the transportation of nutrients and water throughout the body. Nutrients are delivered to cells and tissues, while excess nutrients are stored for future use, particularly in the liver and adipose tissue.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Elimination of Waste</h2>
      <p>The undigested and unabsorbed components of food, along with other waste materials, are formed into feces in the large intestine. The digestive system facilitates the elimination of these waste products from the body through the rectum and anus in a process known as defecation.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Maintenance of Fluid and Electrolyte Balance</h2>
      <p>The digestive system plays a role in maintaining the balance of fluids and electrolytes in the body.Water absorption occurs in the intestines, helping regulate hydration levels and electrolyte concentrations in the blood and tissues.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Immune Defense</h2>
      <p>The digestive system provides a barrier against harmful microorganisms present in ingested food. The stomach, in particular, has acidic conditions that help kill many bacteria and other pathogens. Additionally, the immune cells in the digestive tract help protect the body from infections.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h2>Hormone Production</h2>
      <p>Various hormones are produced and released by organs of the digestive system, such as the stomach and small intestine. These hormones play a role in regulating digestion, nutrient absorption, and overall metabolic processes.</p>
  </section><br><br>
<div id="system" class="jumbotron" >
  <h1>The System in Detail</h1>
<P class="lead">The human digestive system is well-suited for our needs, featuring a diverse set of specialized organs that efficiently process a wide range of foods. Its adaptability, from mechanical breakdown in the mouth to nutrient absorption in the small intestine, reflects the evolutionary efficiency of sustaining human energy and growth.</P></div>

        <img src="download (10).jpeg" alt="Stomach" style="width: 100%; height: 100%;">
        <h2>Stomach</h2>
        <p>The stomach is a muscular organ that stores and breaks down food through mechanical and chemical digestion.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="profile-card">
        <img src="download (8).jpeg" alt="Small Intestine">
        <h2>Small Intestine</h2>
        <p>The small intestine is responsible for nutrient absorption, extracting vital elements from the digested food.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="profile-card">
        <img src="download (9).jpeg" alt="Liver">
        <h2>Liver</h2>
        <p>The liver produces bile, aiding in fat digestion, and plays a crucial role in detoxification and nutrient processing.</p>

    <div class="profile-card">
        <img src="download (11).jpeg" alt="Pancreas">
        <h2>Pancreas</h2>
        <p>The pancreas produces digestive enzymes and hormones, contributing to the breakdown of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.</p>
